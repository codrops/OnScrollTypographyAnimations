            <p>Studying texts and stiff meditation can make you lose your Original Mind.
                A solitary tune by a fisherman, though, can be an invaluable treasure.
                Dusk rain on the river, the moon peeking in and out of the clouds;
                Elegant beyond words, he chants his songs night after night.</p>
            <p>This treasure was discovered in a bamboo thicket &mdash;
                I washed the bowl in a spring and then mended it.
                After morning meditation, I take my gruel in it;
                At night, it serves me soup or rice.
                Cracked, worn, weather-beaten, and misshapen
                But still of noble stock!</p>

                Throw away their lives lusting after things,<br>
                Never able to satisfy their desires,<br>
                Falling into deeper despair<br>

                How long will they be able to enjoy it?<br>
                For one heavenly pleasure<br>
                They suffer ten torments of hell,<br>
                Binding themselves more firmly to the grindstone.<br>
                Such people are like monkeys<br>
                Frantically grasping for the moon in the water<br>
                And then falling into a whirlpool.<br>
                How endlessly those caught up in the floating world suffer.<br>
                Despite myself, I fret over them all night<br>
                And cannot staunch my flow of tears.</p>

            <p>The world before my eyes is wan and wasted, just like me.
                The earth is decrepit, the sky stormy, all the grass withered.
                No spring breeze even at this late date,
                Just winter clouds swallowing up my tiny reed hut.</p>
            <p>The wind has settled, the blossoms have fallen;
                Birds sing, the mountains grow dark &mdash;

            <p>The tree was barren of leaves but you brought a new spring.
                Long green sprouts, verdant flowers, fresh promise.
                Mori, if I ever forget my profound gratitude to you,
                Let me burn in hell forever.</p>
            <p>In a dilapidated three-room hut
                I've grown old and tired;
                This winter cold is the
                Worst I've ever suffered through.
                I sip thin gruel, waiting for the
                Freezing night to pass.
                Can I last until spring finally arrives?
                Unable to beg for rice,
                How will I survive the chill?
                Even meditation helps no longer;
                Nothing left to do but compose poems
                In memory of deceased friends.</p>

            <p>First blooming in the Western Paradise,
                The lotus has delighted us for ages.
                Its white petals are covered with dew,
                its jade green leaves spread out over the pond,
                And its pure fragrance perfumes the wind.
                Cool and majestic, it raises from the murky water.
                The sun sets behind the mountains
                But I remain in the darkness, too captivated to leave.</p>

            <p>My house is buried in the deepest recess of the forest
            Every year, ivy vines grow longer than the year before.
            Undisturbed by the affairs of the world I live at ease,
            Woodmen’s singing rarely reaching me through the trees.
            While the sun stays in the sky, I mend my torn clothes
            And facing the moon, I read holy texts aloud to myself.
            Let me drop a word of advice for believers of my faith.
            To enjoy life's immensity, you do not need many things.</p>

            <p>An old grave hidden away at the foot of a deserted hill,
            Overrun with rank weeds growing unchecked year after year;
            There is no one left to tend the tomb,
            And only an occasional woodcutter passes by.
            Once I was his pupil, a youth with shaggy hair,
            Learning deeply from him by the Narrow River.</p>

            Ten days' worth of rice in my bag;
            a bundle of twigs by the fireplace.
            Why chatter about delusion and enlightenment?
            Listening to the night rain on my roof,
            I sit comfortably, with both legs stretched out.</p>

            This old fellow just likes to smile to himself.
            I wade across streams with bony legs,
            And carry a bag about in fine spring weather.
            That’s my life,

            I wandered here and there for many springs.
            Finally I returned home to settle under a craggy peak.
            I live peacefully in a grass hut,
            Listening to the birds for music.
            Clouds are my best neighbors.
            Below a pure spring where I refresh body and mind;
            Above, towering pines and oaks that provide shade and brushwood.
            Free, so free, day after day --
            I never want to leave!</p>

            befriended by trees and herbs.
            Too lazy to learn right from wrong,
            I laugh at myself, ignoring others.
            Lifting my bony shanks, I cross the stream,
            a sack in my hand, blessed by spring weather.
            Living thus, I want for nothing,
            at peace with all the world.</p>
            <p>Your finger points to the moon,
            but the finger is blind until the moon appears.
            What connection has  moon and finger?
            Are they separate objects or bound?
            This is a question for beginners
            wrapped in seas of ignorance.
            Yet one who looks beyond metaphor
            knows there is no finger; there is no moon.</p>

            <p>Returning to my native village after many years’ absence:
            I put up at a country inn and listen to the rain.
            One robe, one bowl is all I have.
            I light incense and strain to sit in meditation;
            All night a steady drizzle outside the dark window &mdash;

            Remind us to let go and find beauty in the moment.
            The rat race of desire,
            A never-ending cycle of pain,
            Why chase after illusions,
            When true happiness is found within.
            Like a fish swimming in the depths of a clear pond,
            We must dive deep within ourselves,
            To discover the pearl of true contentment.
